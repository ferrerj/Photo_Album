# Photo_Album
Photo Album Java MVC app made in Spring 2014 for Software Methodology With Chris Rios

This project is meant to be a multiuser photoalbum app that allows users to add, remove, and organize photos with search and storage capabilities.

Photos are stored are stored in albums, eaching having name, time, and location data which may be searchable using the search utility.

Included is a work split and further documentation in the docs folder. While both Chris and I had each been primary author on some sections of the program we both had roles to play in each section for the overall application.

Note from ferrerj: I take responsibility for the mess of code that is the popup.java. It had been written under extreme sleep deprivation and it worked so we left it due to a pending deadline.
